## Key Insights

### 1. Account Access
**Summary:** Customers encounter difficulties with account management, restrictions, or login processes.
- **Affected problem reports:** 4 / 14 (28%)
**Evidence:**
- Meta’s moderation is notoriously selective: inflammatory, antagonistic content often stays up unchecked, while honest, candid responses defending yourself get flagged as “violations,” leading to arbitrary restrictions or bans.
- And forget about their false advertisement that if you pay $149 a month for meta verified business and $15 a month for personal accounts that you will have next level customer service and access to a human.
- The fact that I had a benign grandma account with cats, kids, and a 5 star business get shut down is absurd.
- Garbage marketplace restrictions So stupid restriction on how many chats per day is garbage how do they expect people to sell their products or buy anything when you’re restricted to like a few chats a day worthless app deleted and went to mercari and other marketplaces waste of time and stress
**Recommendation:** Enhance the clarity of account-related notifications and establish more effective recovery and appeal procedures.

### 2. Ads Monetization
**Summary:** Users express dissatisfaction with intrusive advertisements or aggressive revenue strategies.
- **Affected problem reports:** 3 / 14 (21%)
**Evidence:**
- Disappointed To many ads and not showing friends comments
- Too many fake ads too many ads that are for companies that are dis reputable and not real too much political drama on both sides.
- Too many ads Not enough friend post

**Summary:** There are issues that affect how users interact with the application.
- **Affected problem reports:** 2 / 14 (14%)
**Evidence:**
- Worst of all, it’s profoundly detrimental to children’s mental health—studies link heavy use to increased anxiety, depression, and body image issues due to endless comparison, cyberbullying, and addictive design.
- My business pages intellectual property, advertising campaigns, client and professional network built over years and years of hardworking— GONE!
**Recommendation:** Reassess recent design modifications through usability testing to ensure smooth navigation in typical user journeys.

### 4. Advertising

### 6. Customer Support
