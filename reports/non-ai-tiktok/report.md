## Key Insights

### 1. Account Access
**Summary:** Users face problems related to account access, bans, or login.
- **Affected problem reports:** 4 / 15 (27%)
**Evidence:**
- Worst social media app ever let me tell u why So I made an account and I started posting videos and I play this game called “steal a Brainrot”and I’m looking to trade and I traded and then this guy named djay_sab started being racist saying that slaves killed people like me (Latinos) and then I say one mean word ONE MEAN WORD and then I got my account banned from messaging,and posting an my account is going to be deleted.WORST APP EVER DO NOT DOWNLOAD
- Banned account Had my account for 6 plus years.
- The app SUCKS Hello I got this app and it was going good at the start until it said I was “too young” so it said it was gonna BAN ME and I made so many friends and followers and many fun moments that made the app feel special so I tryed to defend myself but the stupid stuff didnt work so now I can’t watch TikTok (the go to app for watching videos for me)and now I’m here and I still dunno know why they did this earlier so now I’m stuck with YouTube and brainrot kids (I also made edits that well are now much are just a waste) SO DONT GET TIKTOK
- Kinda Okay I kinda like TikTok but they be letting people ban other people for no reason, i literally commented on a video, showing a man putting a shoe on another man but there was nothing inappropriate about that, I’ve seen people with memes that are NAKED and TikTok is just gonna delete MY comment instead of theres
**Recommendation:** Improve transparency of account actions and provide clearer recovery and appeal mechanisms.
